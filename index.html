         <h2>production ready out of the box!</h2>
         <p>Sipstack.io is an initiative to write a new breed of JVM based SIP stacks that is ops-friendly and high-performing out-of-the-box. It comes with sophisticated configuration, application metrics and operational tools, allowing you and your team to build a production ready SIP service in the shortest amount of time possible.

            <h2>The Base</h2>
            <p>Any SIP stack needs a fast and robust network layer and, equally important, a fast and robust library for the framing and parsing of SIP messages. <a href="http://netty.io">Netty.io</a> is exactly this and is also a library that is well adopted by a large community and has been actively developed for many years. <a href="/pktsio">Pkts.io</a> provides a robust library for framing and parsing many network protocols, including SIP and pkts.io was designed with SIP specifically in mind. Combine these two libraries and you will have a very solid base for a great SIP stack. 
            </p>
            <p>Sipstack.io is an initiative to write a new breed of SIP stacks and is based off of <a href="http://netty.io">netty.io</a> and <a href="/pktsio">pkts.io</a> to provide the base for the stack and currently offers a stateless stack, allowing you to build your own SIP stack with performance built in!
