            <p> Sipstack.io provides a fast and reliable SIP framework whose primary purpose is to provide developers with a stack that is lightweight, ops-friendly and optimized for production deployment out-of-the-box. It comes with sophisticated configuration, application metrics and operational tools, allowing you and your team to build a production ready SIP service in the shortest amount of time possible. <a href="http://netty.io">Netty.io</a> is providing the raw network stack and  <a href="http://www.aboutsip.com/pktsio">pkts.io</a> is the library used for framing and parsing of SIP messages. Currently, it has support for building stateless stacks.
